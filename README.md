# Resbu
A userscript that allows you to start a Luobu server.

## Setup
Install the userscript. Additionally, you need to modify your AppSettings.xml located in 
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/Roblox/Versions/version-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.` Change `BaseUrl` to 
`http://www.s.robloxdev.cn`. If you are using Bloxstrap, copy the AppSettings.xml from 
the Roblox folder to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Bloxstrap/Modifications`.
